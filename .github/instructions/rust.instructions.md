# Rust Coding Conventions and Best Practices

Follow idiomatic Rust practices and community standards when writing Rust code.

These instructions are based on [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/), [RFC 430 naming conventions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0430-finalizing-naming-conventions.md), and the broader Rust community at [users.rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org).

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability, safety, and maintainability.
- Use strong typing and leverage Rust's ownership system for memory safety.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle errors gracefully using `Result<T, E>` and provide meaningful error messages.
- For external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in documentation.
- Use consistent naming conventions following [RFC 430](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0430-finalizing-naming-conventions.md).
- Write idiomatic, safe, and efficient Rust code that follows the borrow checker's rules.
- Ensure code compiles without warnings.
- Do not write duplicated codes; refactor common logic into reusable functions or modules.

## Patterns to Follow

- Use modules (`mod`) and public interfaces (`pub`) to encapsulate logic.
- Handle errors properly using `?`, `match`, or `if let`.
- Use `serde` for serialization and `thiserror` or `anyhow` for custom errors.
- Implement traits to abstract services or external dependencies.
- Structure async code using `async/await` and `tokio` or `async-std`.
- Prefer enums over flags and states for type safety.
- Use builders for complex object creation.
- Split binary and library code (`main.rs` vs `lib.rs`) for testability and reuse.
- Use `rayon` for data parallelism and CPU-bound tasks.
- Use iterators instead of index-based loops as they're often faster and safer.
- Use `&str` instead of `String` for function parameters when you don't need ownership.
- Prefer borrowing and zero-copy operations to avoid unnecessary allocations.

### Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

- Prefer borrowing (`&T`) over cloning unless ownership transfer is necessary.
- Use `&mut T` when you need to modify borrowed data.
- Explicitly annotate lifetimes when the compiler cannot infer them.
- Use `Rc<T>` for single-threaded reference counting and `Arc<T>` for thread-safe reference counting.
- Use `RefCell<T>` for interior mutability in single-threaded contexts and `Mutex<T>` or `RwLock<T>` for multi-threaded contexts.

## Patterns to Avoid

- Don't use `unwrap()` or `expect()` unless absolutely necessary—prefer proper error handling.
- Avoid panics in library code—return `Result` instead.
- Don't rely on global mutable state—use dependency injection or thread-safe containers.
- Avoid deeply nested logic—refactor with functions or combinators.
- Don't ignore warnings—treat them as errors during CI.
- Avoid `unsafe` unless required and fully documented.
- Don't overuse `clone()`, use borrowing instead of cloning unless ownership transfer is needed.
- Avoid premature `collect()`, keep iterators lazy until you actually need the collection.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations—prefer borrowing and zero-copy operations.

## Performance Optimization

Apply these techniques only after profiling identifies a real bottleneck. Optimize algorithms (O-complexity) before micro-optimizing memory or CPU usage.

### Profiling and Benchmarking First

- Use **Criterion** for micro-benchmarks with statistical analysis — never rely on intuition alone.
- Add structured `tracing` spans around hot paths to identify production bottlenecks.
- Track throughput and latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99) for I/O-heavy paths.
- Always measure before *and* after an optimization to confirm improvement.

### Allocation Patterns

- Use `Vec::with_capacity(n)` (and `HashMap::with_capacity(n)`) whenever the final size is known or estimable — eliminates repeated reallocations.
- For hot loops that allocate repeatedly, consider an **object pool**: reuse allocations rather than freeing and re-creating them.
- For tree/graph structures with a single logical lifetime, consider an **arena allocator** (e.g. `bumpalo`) — one bulk deallocation instead of N individual frees.
- **Adaptive pre-allocation**: track the previous allocation size and use a rolling average to seed future `with_capacity` calls in recurring workloads.

### Memory Layout Optimization

- **Hot/cold field separation**: group frequently accessed fields at the top of a struct so they share a cache line; move rarely used fields toward the end or into a separate heap allocation.
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)** over **Array of Structures (AoS)** when only one field is accessed in tight loops — reduces cache pollution significantly.
- Use `#[repr(C)]` when a predictable, C-compatible memory layout is required (FFI, SIMD, memory-mapped I/O).
- Add `#[repr(align(64))]` padding to hot concurrent data to prevent **false sharing** between CPU cores.

### Compile-Time Optimizations

- Use **const generics** to encode array sizes as type parameters — the compiler eliminates bounds checks that would otherwise occur at runtime.
- Prefer **`const fn`** for pure computations (lookup tables, bitmasks, hash seeds) so they execute at compile time rather than every call.
- Use **phantom-type state machines** (`PhantomData<State>`) to enforce valid operation sequences at compile time, removing the need for runtime state checks and impossible-state panics.

### Lazy Evaluation and Streaming

- Use `std::cell::OnceCell` / `once_cell::sync::OnceCell` for fields whose computation is expensive and may not always be needed — compute once, cache forever.
- Process large datasets as **streams** or **iterators** rather than loading them fully into memory. Keep iterator chains lazy; only `.collect()` when the full collection is required by the caller.
- Apply **backpressure** (bounded channels, semaphores) when feeding async pipelines to prevent unbounded memory growth.

### I/O and Database Optimization

- Wrap `File` / `TcpStream` in `BufReader` / `BufWriter` (64 KB buffer is a reasonable default) to reduce the number of system calls.
- **Batch** database writes — accumulate records in a buffer and commit in bulk rather than one row at a time.
- Use **memory-mapped files** (`memmap2`) for zero-copy reads of large, read-heavy datasets.
- Pool database connections (`sqlx::Pool`) rather than opening a new connection per request.

### Lock-Free Concurrency

- Prefer `DashMap` over `Mutex<HashMap>` for high-read, moderate-write concurrent maps — eliminates global locking.
- Use `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` or `std::sync::mpsc` for producer-consumer patterns instead of `Mutex<VecDeque>`.
- Use atomic types (`AtomicUsize`, `AtomicBool`) for simple counters and flags — they are cheaper than a mutex for single-value state.
- When parallelizing with Rayon, size chunks as `(total_items / rayon::current_num_threads()).max(1).min(1000)` to balance overhead against distribution.

### Optimization Priority Order

| Impact | Effort | Techniques                                                             |
|--------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High   | Low    | Zero-copy patterns, `with_capacity`, iterator chains                   |
| High   | Medium | Rayon parallelism, streaming, memory layout redesign, lazy evaluation  |
| High   | High   | Cache-friendly restructuring, lock-free concurrency, custom allocators |

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the Rust Style Guide and use `rustfmt` for automatic formatting.
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.
- Place function and struct documentation immediately before the item using `///`.
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes and enforce best practices.

## Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and `panic!` only for unrecoverable errors.
- Prefer `?` operator over `unwrap()` or `expect()` for error propagation.
- Create custom error types using `thiserror` or implement `std::error::Error`.
- Use `Option<T>` for values that may or may not exist.
- Provide meaningful error messages and context.
- Error types should be meaningful and well-behaved (implement standard traits).
- Validate function arguments and return appropriate errors for invalid input.

## API Design Guidelines

### Common Traits Implementation
Eagerly implement common traits where appropriate:
- `Copy`, `Clone`, `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Hash`, `Debug`, `Display`, `Default`
- Use standard conversion traits: `From`, `AsRef`, `AsMut`
- Collections should implement `FromIterator` and `Extend`
- Note: `Send` and `Sync` are auto-implemented by the compiler when safe; avoid manual implementation unless using `unsafe` code

### Type Safety and Predictability
- Use newtypes to provide static distinctions
- Arguments should convey meaning through types; prefer specific types over generic `bool` parameters
- Use `Option<T>` appropriately for truly optional values
- Functions with a clear receiver should be methods
- Only smart pointers should implement `Deref` and `DerefMut`

### Future Proofing
- Use sealed traits to protect against downstream implementations
- Structs should have private fields
- Functions should validate their arguments
- All public types must implement `Debug`

## Testing and Documentation

- Write comprehensive unit tests using `#[cfg(test)]` modules and `#[test]` annotations.
- Use test modules alongside the code they test (`mod tests { ... }`).
- Write integration tests in `tests/` directory with descriptive filenames.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function, struct, enum, and complex logic.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include comprehensive documentation.
- Document all public APIs with rustdoc (`///` comments) following the [API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Use `#[doc(hidden)]` to hide implementation details from public documentation.
- Document error conditions, panic scenarios, and safety considerations.
- Examples should use `?` operator, not `unwrap()` or deprecated `try!` macro.

## Project Organization

- Use semantic versioning in `Cargo.toml`.
- Include comprehensive metadata: `description`, `license`, `repository`, `keywords`, `categories`.
- Use feature flags for optional functionality.
- Organize code into modules using `mod.rs` or named files.
- Keep `main.rs` or `lib.rs` minimal - move logic to modules.
- **Refactoring & Modularity**: When refactoring large files (e.g. >300 lines) into smaller submodules, utilize the **Facade Pattern**. Re-export the public items from the submodules in the parent `mod.rs` file. This strategy ensures the refactoring remains an internal implementation detail and strictly prevents downstream API breakage.
- **Package-Style Modules for Large Components**: When a component grows beyond a single focused file, prefer converting `foo.rs` into `foo/` with a real `foo/mod.rs` public surface and private submodules beneath it.
- **Intentional Public Surface**: Use `mod.rs` as the canonical API boundary. Export only the small set of items consumers should use, and keep internal helpers in private modules with `pub(super)` visibility where possible.
- **Avoid Deep Public Module Trees**: Do not make helper modules public just to avoid re-exports. Consumers should depend on `crate::path::component::TypeOrFunction`, not `crate::path::component::internal_helper::...`.
- **Facade, Not Barrel**: A parent `mod.rs` should not mechanically re-export everything. It should intentionally expose a stable public API and hide implementation details.
- **Split by Responsibility**: For medium-sized Rust components, separate orchestration/runtime flow, prompt building, validation/parsing, token accounting, and tests into distinct files when that improves cohesion.
- **Test Placement for Large Refactors**: Prefer a dedicated `tests.rs` sibling module for larger integration-style unit tests, while keeping tiny helper-specific tests next to the helper module only when the coupling is strong and local.

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing or reviewing Rust code, ensure:

### Core Requirements
- [ ] **Naming**: Follows RFC 430 naming conventions
- [ ] **Traits**: Implements `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` where appropriate
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Uses `Result<T, E>` and provides meaningful error types
- [ ] **Documentation**: All public items have rustdoc comments with examples
- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

### Safety and Quality
- [ ] **Safety**: No unnecessary `unsafe` code, proper error handling
- [ ] **Performance**: Efficient use of iterators, minimal allocations; hot paths use `with_capacity`, lazy evaluation, or streaming where applicable; profiled before and after any non-trivial optimization
- [ ] **API Design**: Functions are predictable, flexible, and type-safe
- [ ] **Future Proofing**: Private fields in structs, sealed traits where appropriate
- [ ] **Duplicated codes**: Identify duplicated codes and refactored into reusable functions or modules
- [ ] **Unnecessary Wrapped Function Call**: If a function is only calling another function without adding any additional logic, consider removing the wrapper function and calling the inner function directly to reduce unnecessary indirection.
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Apply proper design patterns (e.g., Builder, Strategy, Factory, Newtype, Facade) to write clean, maintainable code
- [ ] **Module Cohesion**: Each file has a single, focused responsibility; split files exceeding ~500 lines or mixing multiple concerns into separate modules. Use the Facade pattern in `mod.rs` to shield consumers from internal refactoring and prevent downstream API breakage.
- [ ] **Tooling**: Code passes `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo nextest run --all-features`
